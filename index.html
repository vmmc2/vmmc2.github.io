                    <p> RobôCIn is a research group of the Computer Center at UFPE which resolve problems using
                        robotics and innovative solutions based on A.I, computer vision, mechanics and electronics. </p>
                    <p> I am currently working in the 2D-Simulation division and focused on developing the strategy of 
                        the agents of our team for the next competitions. </p>
                <li><h3> PETLAB | UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHER - (AUG. 2019 - NOV.2019)</h3> </li>
                    <p> PETLAB is a program developed in a partnership between PET(Programa de Educação Tutorial) and three research and development laboratories present at UFPE: Voxar Labs, LIKA and SPG. </p>
                    <p> I worked as a developer and learned about Computer Vision, OpenCV and  different applications of Cellular Automata.</p>
                <li><h3> UFPE | ASSISTANT TEACHER OF LINEAR ALGEBRA - (AUG. 2018 - AUG. 2019)</h3> </li>
                    <p> Taught tutoring sessions for the students. Also made presentations that were used by the students as a way for them to prepare for the exams. </p>
                    <p> Prepared some lists of exercises and a series of exams that were used as a part of the final grade of the students. </p>

        <h1> PROJECTS </h1>
            <ul> 
                <li><h3> CInGAMES </h3> </li>
                    <p> CInGames is a project that contains 3 different games (Pong, Minesweeper and Genius) and these games can be played at the Altera DE2i-150 FPGA Board. I worked on the development of the Genius game and
                        I was also responsible to develop the Driver, so that these games could be played in the board.</p>
                <li><h3> COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING </h3> </li>
                    <p> Competitive Programming is a repository that I made which contains solutions for several problems about algorithms and data structures from different online judges such as: Codeforces, UVa, SPOJ, LeetCode, The Huxley, URI and more. It was made for educational purpose and to help other students in order to solve these problems. </p>
                    <p> Relevant technologies used: C, C++, Python.</p>
                <li><h3> NEMESIS </h3> </li>
                    <p> Nemesis is a cache simulator of 1024 words made using Python. It can simulate 16 different types of cache and supports both write access and read access. It was mainly developed using the RISC-V architecture as a basis and inspiration. </p>
                    <p> Relevant technologies used: Python. </p>
                <li><h3> RISC-V DISASSEMBLER AND ISA SIMULATOR </h3> </li>
                    <p> This project consists in a disassembler made for the RISC-V architecture. It was developed to work only in the RV-32I extension. 
                        It receives a set of instructions in hexadecimal format, it executes these instructions (changing both the content of registers and memory).
                        It also generates the RISC-V assembly code equivalent to the instructions in the hexadecimal that were passed as input, and puts this assembly code 
                        into a .txt file. </p>
                    <p> This project was conceived using C/C++ and it was mainly based on a Assignment passed to the students from UC Berkeley.</p>
                <li><h3> GASOLINA: GREVE INFINITA </h3> </li>
                    <p> Gasolina: Greve Infinita is a Battle-Royale game that can be played by at most 4 players in a local server. After the development, the game was tested by freshman students.</p>
                    <p> Responsible for the game art and for the development of the game's mechanics. Relevant technologies used: C.</p>
                <li><h3> HANGMAN BOOTLOADER </h3> </li>
                    <p> This project was made as part of an assignment from the discipline Software Infrastructure. It consists of a bootloader that has a hangman game which the user can play while the 
                        Operational System is getting initialized.
                    </p>
                    <p> Relevant Technologies used in the project: x86 Assembly and MakeFile.</p>
